**Portfolio website**

During my summer holiday this year (2020), I created my portfolio website to use the skills I have enquired during my first year of front-end development. 

This is only the first version. My plan is to redesign the website within a year and practise more of what I will learn during 2020-2021 :woman_student: :books:. Stay tuned!
