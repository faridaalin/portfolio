    "My name is Farida and I am a front-end development student, currently living in Oslo, Norway. In 2015 I graduated from BI with a bachelor's degree in International Marketing. After 4 years in the media industry I missed continuous self-development and the ability to be part of a fast-moving industry that is always pushing me to development my skills. In front-end development I found the opportunity to be creative, learn and best of all, make things alive!",
